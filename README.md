## Description
The game is a turn-based card game between two opponents. 
Players construct decks along with a hero which has a unique ability.
Players use their limited mana crystals to play abilities or summon 
minions to attack the opponent, with the goal of destroying the opponent's hero.

Winning matches and completing quests earn in-game gold, 
and rewards in the form of new cards, and other in-game prizes.
Players can then buy packs of new cards through gold
to customize and improve their decks.
